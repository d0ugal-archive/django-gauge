Django gauge
========================================
Automatically runs and displays the results of djangobench over time.

Currentlt, you will need to use the boto recognised enviroment settings to
provide your AWS credentials. Benchmarks take a while, to avoid the eratic
results (defaults at 1000 runs per test.)


Thanks
=========
Thanks to Jacob Kaplan-Moss for creating djangobench and django-dev-dashboard
(from which much code was borrowered).
