Django gauge
========================================

Django Gauge is a runner and result store for djangobench. It automatillcay
runs defined benhmark suites, that compare two versions of Django.

This is still a work in progress and the result display greatly needs work to
make it clearer and more useful, but its getting there.

Thanks

Thanks to Jacob Kaplan-Moss for creating djangobench and django-dev-dashboard
(from which much code was borrowered).
